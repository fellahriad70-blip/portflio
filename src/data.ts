  "I am Ikram Aissiou, an independent researcher in medical image analysis and computational neuroscience, based in Algiers, Algeria. My work develops machine learning methods for clinical decision support across oncological imaging and neurological disease, with a sustained emphasis on how such models characterise their own uncertainty.",
  "I am a member of the BASIRA Lab 2026 cohort (Master GNNs for Rising Stars) at Imperial College London (I-X), under Prof. Islem Rekik, and a mentee in both the MICCAI Mentorship Programme (2025–2026) and the RISE-MICCAI Mentorship Programme, the MICCAI Society initiative reinforcing inclusiveness for researchers in low-to-middle income countries. I completed training in computational neuroscience through Neuromatch Academy, and attended the MICCAI Winter School at MBZUAI, Abu Dhabi, and the RISE-MICCAI Summer School on diffusion models and graph learning.",
  "In oncology, my research concerns volumetric tumour segmentation and multi-task prognostic modelling: breast cancer in multi-centre DCE-MRI, head-and-neck tumours in multimodal PET/CT with joint TN staging and recurrence-free survival estimation, and paediatric brain tumours where transfer learning from adult cohorts must compensate for scarce annotated data. In neuroscience, I model neurophysiological signals with spatial-temporal graph and state-space architectures — patient-independent epileptic seizure detection from EEG, ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, and multimodal Parkinson's disease assessment.",
  "Running through all of this is a single methodological conviction: a model that cannot express doubt cannot responsibly inform a diagnosis. I therefore treat calibration, out-of-distribution behaviour and dataset reliability as primary research objects rather than post-hoc diagnostics.",
  "I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science and Analysis (Honours, Excellent) and a B.Sc. in Information Systems and Software Engineering (Very Good) from the University of Algiers 1 Benyoucef Benkhedda. Alongside research I serve as an NVIDIA Deep Learning Instructor and Ambassador, and head the Risk Management Department at CCR, the Compagnie Centrale de Réassurance, in Algiers. I have taught algorithmics at my own university and data science at GoMyCode, and I designed and organised the PARK-GNN Challenge, a full graph-learning competition with automated scoring and a live leaderboard.",

      "Accuracy is the wrong headline metric for clinical deployment. What matters is whether a model can tell you when it is out of its depth.",
    body: [
      "Ask a radiologist how confident they are and you will get an answer with structure: high for a finding they see every day, low for something at the edge of their experience, and a clear threshold below which they escalate to a colleague. Most deployed models have no equivalent. They return a probability, and the probability is calibrated to the training distribution and nothing else.",
      "This is the gap my work keeps returning to. In the Immun-AI project we built a decision-support platform for systemic lupus erythematosus that fuses clinical, imaging and molecular data, and the design question that dominated the work was not accuracy. It was leakage safety and the honest expression of uncertainty — the system needed to know when to decline to answer.",
      "**A model that cannot express doubt cannot be trusted with a diagnosis.** That sounds rhetorical, but it has a precise operational meaning: if your predicted probabilities are not calibrated, then downstream decisions that depend on thresholding those probabilities are systematically wrong, and the error is not visible in your accuracy metric.",
      "There is a second, less discussed layer. Before you can quantify a model's uncertainty you have to establish that the dataset itself is reliable. Labels can be wrong, cohorts can be imbalanced in ways that mimic signal, and preprocessing can leak information across the train/test boundary. In multi-centre imaging this is the norm rather than the exception — the centre a scan came from is often a better predictor than the pathology.",
      "So the research programme I want to pursue is: characterise the dataset first, quantify the model second, and only then report performance. Beyond Accuracy, the framework for dataset reliability currently under review at Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, is an attempt to formalise the first of those three steps.",

      "The challenge data spans multiple centres, and the centres differ in scanner, protocol, contrast timing and coil configuration. Training on the full mixed cohort produced a model that learned centre-specific artefacts alongside anatomy. Validation performance was respectable and generalisation was poor.",
      "**We trained on less data and got a better model.** Selecting by image quality — the DUKE and NACT subsets — and training nnU-Net on those, with a phase-aware input configuration, gave a best validation Dice of 0.72 with 3-phase nnU-Net 3D full-resolution. The larger mixed set did not reach it.",
      "The mechanism is not mysterious. Multi-centre variability is not noise you can average away; it is structured confounding. A capacity-limited model allocates that capacity to whatever explains the most variance, and if centre identity explains more variance than tumour boundary, that is what gets learned.",
      "The practical lesson for clinical deployment: curation is not a preprocessing step you skip once you have enough data. It is a modelling decision with the same status as architecture or loss function, and in multi-centre settings it is usually the one with the highest return.",

      "Why represent a set of electrodes as a graph, and why bolt a state-space model onto it — the reasoning behind NeuroGraphMamba.",
    body: [
      "An EEG recording is a stack of channels over time. The conventional representation is a tensor: channels × time. That representation is faithful to the acquisition hardware and almost silent about the thing you actually care about, which is the evolving pattern of coupling between cortical regions.",
      "Representing electrodes as graph nodes and their functional relationships as edges makes that coupling first-class. A graph convolution can pass information between two electrodes whose interaction is informative, regardless of where they sit on the montage. In seizure detection this matters, because the discriminative signal is often the spread of synchrony rather than the amplitude at any single channel.",
      "**Patient-independence is the hard part.** A model that detects seizures with high accuracy within one patient's recordings has learned that patient's baseline. In a clinical setting you do not have the patient's baseline at first presentation. So the architecture has to find features that transfer across patients with different baselines, different electrode placements and different pathology.",
      "The state-space component addresses the temporal side. Seizures evolve over tens of seconds, and the onset pattern is more informative than the ictal plateau. Mamba-style selective state-space models give you the long-range dependency handling of a transformer with linear scaling in sequence length, which is what you need for continuous monitoring rather than segmented epochs.",
      "Combining the two — spatial-temporal graph convolutions carrying the inter-electrode message passing, and a state-space backbone carrying the temporal integration — is what we submitted to AMAI at MICCAI 2026. It is one answer, not the answer, and the ablations we ran suggest the graph construction step matters more than either component.",

      "This is not a complaint. It is a description of a research mode that is now genuinely viable in medical imaging, and that the MICCAI community has deliberately enabled. The MAMA-MIA, HECKTOR and ISLES challenges all publish their data openly. The Deep Breath, SWITCH+ and AMAI workshops review submissions through open peer review. Nobody asked which institution I belonged to.",
      "**The barrier that remains is not access to data. It is access to mentorship.** Writing a paper is a skill learned by having someone who has written thirty of them tell you that your related-work section is a list and not an argument. RISE-MICCAI and the MICCAI Mentorship Programme exist precisely to supply that, and for me they did — Nina Weng's comments on a draft did more for that paper than any amount of re-reading my own writing.",
      "The BASIRA 2026 programme under Prof. Islem Rekik was the other decisive one. Graph neural networks are a crowded field and the difference between a publishable and an unpublishable paper is usually whether the experimental design isolates the claimed contribution. Learning that distinction from a group that has published in it for a decade is not something you can reconstruct from arXiv.",
      "For anyone in a similar position: the practical advice is short. Pick a challenge with public data and a public leaderboard, because it gives you a falsifiable target. Read the previous year's winning entries before writing code. Find a mentor through a programme rather than a cold email, because programmes come with a norm that the mentor will actually respond. And write the paper before you think it is ready.",
